# Login-page-automation-using-java-and-selenium
Automated the login functionality of a web application using Selenium WebDriver with Java. Utilized different locators (e.g., By.id, By.name, By.xpath) to interact with web elements like username field, password field, and login button. Wrote reusable functions to perform login actions, including entering credentials and clicking the login button.
